			<h2>Step 2: Wash Your Apple</h2>
			<p>Before eating your apple, be sure to wash it thoroughly under running water. This will help remove any dirt, bacteria, or pesticides that may be present on the skin. Dry your apple with a clean towel or paper towel before moving on to the next step.</p>

			<h2>Step 3: Cut Your Apple (Optional)</h2>
			<p>If you prefer to eat your apple sliced, you can cut it into pieces using a sharp knife. Be sure to remove the core and any seeds before cutting. You can also use an apple slicer to make the process easier and more efficient.</p>

		<section id="step-4">
			<h2>Step 4: Hold Your Apple Properly</h2>
			<p>Hold your apple with one hand, placing your thumb on one end and your four fingers on the other end. This will give you a good grip on the apple while you eat it.</p>

                <p>Chew the apple slowly and thoroughly, allowing the enzymes in your saliva to break down the food and aid in digestion. Swish the apple around in your mouth to make sure you get the full flavor.</p>

                <h2>Step 10: Dispose of the Core</h2>
                <p>When you have finished eating your apple, dispose of the core in a compost bin or trash can. If you are eating an apple on the go, look for a trash can to dispose of the core responsibly.</p>
